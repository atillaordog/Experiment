Experiment
==========

You ever wanted to conduct easy experiments, but you did not have the needs to do it?
What if creating an experiment would be easy as building a lego castle?

This project tries to acomplish this by using an easy approach to experiments.

Only 3 main things are the building blocks of this project.
There is an environment that has a 2 dimensional grid.
There is a creature that can move freely on this grid.
And then there is a knowledge that is fixed on a point of the grid.
